### Library and Research Support Orientation

11am-12pm Tuesday 10 September

Colombo Theatre C

Facilitator: Liz Stokes

This is the introductory session for participants in the Library and Research Support Stream at ResBaz. Participants will be introduced to the aims and values of ResBaz, the code of conduct and what to expect at ResBaz over the next 3 days.

### Train the Trainer: Advocating Impact

1-3pm Tuesday 10 September

Goldstein G09

Facilitators: Jacinta Byrne UNSW; Leanne Webster, Sam Hutchin, AJ Corradi UOW.

This workshop will develop skills in advocating impact to their researcher communities, sharing stories and engaging participants in practical activities. At the University of Wollongong, librarians have teamed up with the research office to support academic communities to discover and collate evidence to support the real world impact of their research, including ARC Impact stories, ARC & NHMRC Grant applications, and internal promotion applications.  UNSW Library is equipping library staff to respond to the growing demand for advice and services in this area through a staff capacity building program based on a Bibliometric Capability Framework. Developing these capabilities will strengthen staff capacity to participate in strategic discussions as informed stakeholders with analysis on sector trends and knowledge of discussions around responsible use of metrics for research impact planning, tracking and reporting.

### Festival session: Publishing your research strategically

4-5pm Tuesday 10 September

Colombo Theatre C

Presenter: Kassie Dmitrieff, UNSW

This workshop is a practical tour of tips and tricks to help you get your research noticed using emerging scholarly communications platforms. Social media smarts, publishing strategies and choosing appropriate metrics will be covered.

### Workforce skills development: how do we meet researcher needs?

11am-12pm Wednesday 

Colombo Theatre C

Facilitator: Emily Brennan, MQ.

Lightning presentations: Djamila Hacene UNSW, Liz Stokes ARDC.

This session will feature a facilitated discussion on the skills development of the research support workforce. Organisational units offering support in grants administration, eResearch technologies, researcher training and Library services are all impacted by new methods and technologies in data intensive research. Data innovations can also be leveraged internally to deliver better services. What are the skills needed and how can organisational units collaborate to align strategic objectives and deliver services together at the point of need? To initiate discussion, highlights from the ARDC Skilled Workforce Summit and case studies addressing key challenges for data skills workforce development will be shared. Participants should come prepared for a frank and fearless discussion of challenges and opportunities for developing capacity to support researchers working in data intensive research.

### Train the Trainer: walk the data talk

1-3pm Wednesday 11 Sept

Facilitator: Phillippa Bourke, USYD. 

Presenters: Andreas Mertin UTS, Ben Casimir UTS. Emma Clift & Lucia Lin UTS, Ryan Stoker USYD.

Do you catch yourself advocating better filenaming conventions, version control and back up procedures to researchers, all the while grimacing at how things could be better in your own workplace? This is the workshop for you! This workshop will showcase examples of good data management practice applied to internal library and research support processes. Case studies to be shared include demonstrating the FAIR data principles in action, open refine use cases & data workflows, and avoiding common pitfalls in managing structured data. Flex your digital dexterity and gain confidence in practical data skills you can apply immediately.

### Festival session: How to: Open Access Tools for researchers & making your research FAIR

4-5pm Wednesday 11 September

Colombo Theatre A

Properly managed research data can facilitate research transparency and enable knowledge discovery, not to mention take the headaches out of managing data across multiple platforms, tools and services. Come along to this session and find out how you can apply the FAIR data principles and take better care of your research data. This is a hands on workshop for participants to try out some of the tools and services that Ginny Barbour introduced in her keynote. Bring your open access questions, qualms and inquiring minds!

### Train the Trainer: FAIR enough

1-3pm Thursday 12 September

Goldstein G09

Facilitators: Maude Frances UNSW, Piyachat Ratana USYD.

This workshop will focus on user stories of what outreach librarians face and what researchers’ questions are back to the FAIR data principles. Participants will be able to advise researchers (or direct them to resources) on requirements for managing research data that optimise the following:
- Discovery of the data by others
- Access to the data by humans and machines - under specific conditions if necessary
- Possibilities for the data to be shared, combined and exchanged
- Understanding of context and conditions associated with the data: ownership, provenance, research methods, permissions for re-use.
