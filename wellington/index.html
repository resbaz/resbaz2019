        <strong>Raqi Syed</strong>
        <p>
    Raqi's research is primarily focused on the relationship between digital technology and narrativity. 

    She began her career at Disney Feature Animation and went on to work as a Senior Technical Director with Weta Digital on films such as <em>Avatar</em>, <em>The Planet of the Apes</em>, and <em>The Hobbit</em>. Now a Senior Lecturer at Victoria University's School of Design, her experience as a Visual Effects Artist informs her critical writing about cinema and how new technologies continue to shape our contemporary understanding of storytelling. 
    <p>
      Raqi's research pivots around the idea that new mediums like virtual reality must draw upon and extend the tradition of established media such as literature, theater, and film.

      <p>
        Recently,&nbsp;The Los Angeles Times&nbsp;pegged Raqi for its list of <a href="http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-et-mn-academy-diversity-candidates/?track=lat-pick">100 Industry professionals who can help fix Hollywood’s Diversity Problem.</a>

        <p>
      A master of synthesising complex information into compelling and convincing narratives, Geoffrey Batchen is acknowleged as one of the world's leading experts on the history of photography. He is particularly interested in the way that photography mediates every other aspect of modern life, whether we're talking about sex or war, atoms or planets, commerce or art.

      <p>Batchen has published extensively, in twenty languages to date. He is the author of key texts such as <em>Burning with Desire: The Conception of Photography</em> (1997, with subsequent translations into Spanish, Korean, Japanese, Slovenian and Chinese); <em>Each Wild Idea: Writing, Photography, History</em> (2001 and in Chinese); <em>Forget Me Not: Photography and Remembrance</em> (2004); <em>Emanations: The Art of Cameraless Photography</em> (2016); and <em>Apparitions: Photography and Dissemination</em> (2018)..
