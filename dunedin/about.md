# About

The Research Bazaar is a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy emerging at the centre of modern research. Throughout 2019 (but with a focus on late January / early February), events will be held at a number of university campuses around the globe.

Hosted by the University of Otago, the 2019 Dunedin Research Bazaar is a free-of-charge event comprising three days of workshops, demonstrations, and talks (February 11-13), where researchers come together to up-skill in ‘next generation digital research tools and skills’.  

In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun!<br><br> Who should attend? Researchers at ALL levels from ALL disciplines.

We are still working on the programme to bring you a broad range of digital research skills topics - below are some of the sessions that will be on offer.
