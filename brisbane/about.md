# About ResBaz Brisbane 2019

The Research Bazaar is a worldwide skill- and community-building festival promoting the essential digital skills researchers need to perform modern research. 

Throughout 2019, events will be held at a [number of other sites around the globe](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2019/), including Brisbane.

Queensland University of Technology, in conjunction with The University of Queensland, Griffith University, the University of Southern Queensland, and Queensland Cyber Infrastructure Foundation (QCIF) are proud to present 2019's Research Bazaar Brisbane. The aim of the event is to equip researchers from all career stages and disciplines with the digital skills and tools required to do their research better, faster, and smarter.

# Who can attend?

The event is aimed at researchers at all levels from all disciplines based in south east Queensland. ResBaz is particularly aimed at those new to digital research tools.

If you are a Master's or PhD student, or an early career researcher, then ResBaz Brisbane is definitely for you! ResBaz Brisbane will help you find others across a range of universities who are exploring the same research problems or trying to learn the same tools and skills. 

ResBaz Brisbane will definitely be one of the most worthwhile networking and skill-building opportunities you can attend in Brisbane this year - and it's fantastic value.  

# What will I learn?

We will offer introductory workshops such as Software Carpentry with R and Software Carpentry with Python, as well as workshops on data clean up and data visualisation, and tips on boosting your research profile. See the program below. You can opt in to various workshops when you register. You can learn how to program in R or Python, see how to automate workflows, how to keep track of different versions of things and then tell stories with your data. Interested in mapping? There will be a GIS workshop and a Galaxy workshop for those wanting to learn about RNA sequencing. Want to run a Jupyter notebook in the cloud? We can show you how. And you can see the Tinker workbench in operation too. It's all happening in those first two days.
